# speechticulate
webkit speech recognition for articulate presentations

to install:
- get this repo as well as the `voicecontrol` branch of `dark-spider`.
- open your `chrome://extensions` page and make sure "Developer mode" checkbox is checked in the upper right corner.
- click the "Load unpacked extension" button.
- navigate to this folder on your local machine, and select the `v0.1` folder.

currently working for "next" command and in localhost only (trying to figure out how to allow chrome extensions in the file protocol).
